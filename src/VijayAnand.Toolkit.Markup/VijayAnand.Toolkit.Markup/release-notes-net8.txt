What's new in ver. 3.5.0:
-------------------------
1. Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Compatibility package is no longer a dependency.

2. Extension methods for Span to set Text and TextColor.

new Span().Text("Hyperlink", Colors.Blue)

new Span().Text("Hyperlink").TextColor(Colors.Blue)

3. Extension method for Picker to set the Items inline.

new Picker().Items(["Red", "Green", "Blue"])

4. Extension method for BindableLayout to set the Items inline (with IEnumerable<T> as its parameter).

new StackLayout().ItemsSource(["Red", "Green", "Blue"])

v3.4.0:

1. The typed binding Gesture method's LINQ expression is constrained to return a value of type ICommand

2. Add a wrapper method for binding BindableLayout's ItemsSource as a LINQ expression

new StackLayout()
    .ItemTemplate((DataTemplate)Resources["CardLayout"])
    .ItemsSource(static (HomeViewModel vm) => vm.Orders);

v3.3.0:

1. New Gesture methods (suffixed with v2) that work based on the LINQ expression rather than classic reflection-based bindings.

This form of binding supports nested properties, default properties, and most importantly type safety and compile time validation.
