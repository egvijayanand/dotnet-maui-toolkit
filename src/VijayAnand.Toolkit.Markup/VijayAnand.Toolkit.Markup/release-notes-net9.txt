v4.0.0-preview.4:

1. Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Compatibility package is no longer a dependency.

2. Extension methods for Span to set Text and TextColor.

new Span().Text("Hyperlink", Colors.Blue)

new Span().Text("Hyperlink").TextColor(Colors.Blue)

3. Extension method for Picker to set the Items inline.

new Picker().Items(["Red", "Green", "Blue"])

new StackLayout().ItemsSource(["Red", "Green", "Blue"])

v4.0.0-preview.3:

1. The typed binding Gesture method's LINQ expression is constrained to return a value of type ICommand

2. Add a wrapper method for binding BindableLayout's ItemsSource as a LINQ expression

new StackLayout()
    .ItemTemplate((DataTemplate)Resources["CardLayout"])
    .ItemsSource(static (HomeViewModel vm) => vm.Orders);

v4.0.0-preview.2:

1. New Gesture methods (suffixed with v2) that work based on the LINQ expression rather than classic reflection-based bindings.
