What's new in ver. 4.0.0-preview.3:
-----------------------------------
1. The typed binding Gesture method's LINQ expression is constrained to return a value of type ICommand

2. Add a wrapper method for binding BindableLayout's ItemsSource as a LINQ expression

new StackLayout()
    .ItemTemplate((DataTemplate)Resources["CardLayout"])
    .ItemsSource(static (HomeViewModel vm) => vm.Orders);

v4.0.0-preview.2:

1. New Gesture methods (suffixed with v2) that work based on the LINQ expression rather than classic reflection-based bindings.

This form of binding supports nested properties, default properties, and most importantly type safety and compile time validation.
