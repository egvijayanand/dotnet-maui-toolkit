What's new in ver. 1.0.1-pre1:

Route parameters in the Navigation service methods can also be passed as Tuple (string key, object value).

Now GoBackAsync method also takes parameters.

The objective is to ease the development of the Razor Class Library (RCL) so that it can be shared with all Blazor targets (.NET MAUI, Blazor Server and WebAssembly, Windows Forms, and WPF).

And .NET MAUI targets Android, iOS, macOS (via Mac Catalyst), Tizen, and Windows (via WinUI 3).

To start with defines the following abstractions:

1. Dialogs - IDialogService
2. Navigation - INavigationService
3. Share - IShareService
4. Theme - IThemeService

A Model class for UserToken and frequently used Constants for OAuth / OIDC authentication.
