What's new in ver. 2.1.0-preview.1:
-----------------------------------
Note: Version # is aligned with the other packages in this suite.

1. Initial version of VijayAnand.MauiToolkit.Pro version of NuGet package.

2. Has dependency on CommunityToolkit.Maui and VijayAnand.MauiToolkit.Core NuGet packages.

3. To start with, a custom definition of the Dialogs based on the CommunityToolkit's Popup type.

3.1 This DialogService class is the implementation of the IDialogService interface definition in the Core package.

3.2 Register the dependency in the startup pipeline (MauiProgram.cs) with a call to the UseVijayAnandMauiToolkitPro() method:

Sample code:

public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder.UseMauiApp<App>()
               .UseMauiCommunityToolkit()
               .UseVijayAnandMauiToolkitPro();

        return builder.Build();
    }
}
