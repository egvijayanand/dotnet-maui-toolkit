What's new in ver. 1.0.0-pre4:

Updated release of VijayAnand.MauiToolkit NuGet package and is released on top of .NET MAUI Preview 14.

This release includes the Markup extension methods for rapid application development with C#.

These fluent APIs are made available in the VijayAnand.MauiToolkit.Markup namespace.

Now it's possible to selectively register the services required into the DI container.

Configure the UseVijayAnandMauiToolkit() method with configuration parameter of type ServiceRegistrations (Flags-attributed) enum

To illustrate with a sample, if only interested in NavigationService:

Then, invoke UseVijayAnandMauiToolkit(ServiceRegistrations.Navigation)

And if DialogService is required along with NavigationService:

Then, invoke UseVijayAnandMauiToolkit(ServiceRegistrations.Dialogs | ServiceRegistrations.Navigation)

By default, the configuration parameter value is set to ServiceRegistrations.All
