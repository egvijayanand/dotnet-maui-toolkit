What's new in ver. 1.0.0-pre1:

Initial release of VijayAnand.MauiToolkit NuGet package.

It depends on VijayAnand.MauiToolkit.Core NuGet package.

To start with, implements the concrete definition of the abstractions defined in Core package:

1. Dialogs - DialogService (works with MainPage or Shell definition)

    1.1 Additional abstraction specific to .NET MAUI

2. Navigation - NavigationService (based on Shell Navigation pattern)

3. Share - ShareService (based on Maui Essentials)

Most importantly, provides the below method to register these services in .NET MAUI host builder startup:

UseVijayAnandMauiToolkit()

Usage:

public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
{
    var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
    builder.UseMauiApp<App>().UseVijayAnandMauiToolkit();
    return builder.Build();
}
