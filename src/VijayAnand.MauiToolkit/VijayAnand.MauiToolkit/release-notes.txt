What's new in ver. 1.0.0-pre5:

Updated release of VijayAnand.MauiToolkit NuGet package and is built on top of .NET MAUI Preview 14.

This release includes additional Markup extension methods for accessing the resources.

These fluent APIs, from the Utility class, are made available in the VijayAnand.MauiToolkit.Markup namespace.

Add a static using statement like, global using static VijayAnand.MauiToolkit.Markup.Utility; and then access the methods directly.

Most useful method will be:

T? AppResource<T>(string key)

Updated the NavigationService implementation such that those methods will raise a NotSupportedException if Shell is not enabled.
