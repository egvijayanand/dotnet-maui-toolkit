Join me on Developer Thoughts, https://egvijayanand.in/, an exclusive blog for .NET MAUI and Blazor.

What's new in ver. 3.0.0-preview.1:
-----------------------------------
Initial release built on top of .NET 8 Preview.

WaitingPage, a page with a customizable busy indicator to show the progress to the user.

Support for the Tizen platform will be included in a later version once the Tizen team releases the workload that supports .NET 8 Previews.
