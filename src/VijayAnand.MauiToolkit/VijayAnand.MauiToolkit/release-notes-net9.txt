Join me on Developer Thoughts, https://egvijayanand.in/, an exclusive blog for .NET MAUI and Blazor.

What's new in ver. v4.1.0:
--------------------------
The integrated app hosting builder method has been enhanced to support Application, Window, and Page in a single generic method call.

The prebuilt Window type can be used as it is. No need for a factory delegate for simple scenarios.

While using generic overloads, there's no need to register the types in the DI container.

var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
builder.UseMauiApp<App, Window, MainPage>();
// To use Shell as the initial page.
//builder.UseMauiApp<App, Window, AppShell>();
// Other configuration
return builder.Build();

Other overloads continue to work too.

v4.0.0:

Release built on top of .NET MAUI 9.

MauiAppBuilder extension methods provide an easy way to host both Application and Window with just a single method call.

A single place to handle all configuration-related tasks.

The Application type will simply act as a container for global resources and handle startup and shutdown events.

// To use the Window type as it is.

var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
builder.UseMauiApp<App, Window>(sp => new Window(new MainPage()) { Title = "MyApp" });
// Rest of the configuration ...
return builder.Build();

For customization, extend the Window type and link it here.

builder.UseMauiApp<App, MainWindow>();
