Join me on Developer Thoughts, https://egvijayanand.in/, an exclusive blog for .NET MAUI and Blazor.

What's new in ver. v4.0.0:
--------------------------
Release built on top of .NET MAUI 9.

MauiAppBuilder extension methods provide an easy way to host both Application and Window with just a single method call.

A single place to handle all configuration-related tasks.

The Application type will simply act as a container for global resources and handle startup and shutdown events.

// To use the Window type as it is.

var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
builder.UseMauiApp<App, Window>(sp => new Window(new MainPage()) { Title = "MyApp" });
// Rest of the configuration ...
return builder.Build();

For customization, extend the Window type and link it here.

builder.UseMauiApp<App, MainWindow>();
